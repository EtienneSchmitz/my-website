Welcome to my personal CV website.  
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Deploy on Vercel

I deploy my Next.js app in [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/).
When I commit in main branch, automatically etienne-schmitz.com is update.

## Frameworks CSS

I plan to use [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) for my css components instead of material-ui.
